# The Daily Machine Spirit — Claude Code Guide

## Project

A satirical website: AI and vibe coding turn software engineers into tech-priests who recite rituals and prompts
instead of understanding their tools. Every day at 00:00 UTC an LLM writes one **prayer** or **ritual** to the Machine
Spirit, plus a **Heretical Truth**: one or two plain sentences on what really happens. Visitors react with **Blessed**
or **Heresy**.

- Tagline: *In the grim darkness of the far future, no one reads the code.* Footer: *Knowledge is lost. The rituals
  remain.*
- It runs on existing shared Azure resources (the SQL server and database, Key Vault, the Azure OpenAI models, Grafana)
  rather than its own copies.
- Runs as **one Azure Functions app** (Flex Consumption, .NET 10 isolated worker): a timer generates the daily item,
  HTTP functions serve the pages and the API. Cloudflare sits in front (`dailymachinespirit.fyi`).

## Solution layout

```
src/DailyMachineSpirit.Functions  — the Functions app (HTTP and timer functions)
tests/DailyMachineSpirit.Tests    — xUnit unit tests
tools/coverage.ps1                — tests + coverage report + the coverage gate (Build and Test runs it)
infra/                            — Bicep for all of Azure (main.bicep); infra/README.md covers what Bicep can't do
```

## Code style rules

- **No underscore prefix** on private fields (`context`, not `_context`).
- **`this.` only when required** to disambiguate a field from a same-named parameter.
- **No default arguments** on method parameters: callers always pass explicitly
  (e.g. `CancellationToken cancellationToken`, never `= default`).
- **Tests check behaviour, not logs.** Assert on outcomes: what's saved, returned or sent. Never on log messages, and
  don't add tests whose only purpose is a log line. To wait for background work, wait for its observable result.
- Spell out names in workflows and jobs ("Deploy Master", not "CD").

## Ground rules

- **Legal (unofficial fan satire):** nothing commercial (no ads, donations or shop); no Games Workshop logos, artwork,
  lettering lookalikes or quoted text; no lookalike of the Adeptus Mechanicus cog-skull or the Imperial Aquila; no GW
  trademarks in the name, logo or headings (a single prayer may mention "the Omnissiah"). The generation prompt must
  forbid quoting GW text. The footer carries the GW disclaimer.
- **Privacy:** never store or log anything about visitors (no IPs, no user agents). Reactions are anonymous.
- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.2 AA wins over design fidelity; record each such change in the design docs.
- **No secrets:** Azure is reached with managed identities and GitHub's OIDC; credentials that must exist live in Key
  Vault, and their values are set by hand, never in the repo or in Bicep.
- **Infrastructure as code:** every Azure resource and role assignment is in `infra/` (Bicep). Change Azure by changing
  the Bicep, never by hand in the portal, so the files stay the truth.

## Key design decisions

- **Routes at the site root:** `host.json` sets `routePrefix` to `""`, so `/healthz` is `/healthz`, not `/api/healthz`.
- **`/healthz`** returns `{status, version}`; `version` is the short commit, which the .NET SDK puts into the
  assembly's informational version when it builds in a git checkout (`AppVersion`). A build outside git says `dev`.

## Building and testing

```
dotnet build DailyMachineSpirit.slnx
./tools/coverage.ps1        # tests, the coverage gate, HTML report at coverage/index.html
```

The minimum line coverage is **95%** (`$MinLineCoverage` in `tools/coverage.ps1`). If some code really can't be covered,
ask the owner before lowering it; never lower it just to get a PR through.

## Running locally

Needs Azure Functions Core Tools v4 (`winget install Microsoft.Azure.FunctionsCoreTools`).

```
cd src/DailyMachineSpirit.Functions
cp local.settings.example.json local.settings.json   # once; local.settings.json is git-ignored
func start
```

HTTP functions run without storage. Timer functions need `AzureWebJobsStorage`: run the Azurite emulator
(`docker run -p 10000-10002:10000-10002 mcr.microsoft.com/azure-storage/azurite`).

## Build and Test

`.github/workflows/build-and-test.yml` (**Build and Test**, job `build-and-test`) runs on every PR and on pushes to
`master`: restore, Release build, then `tools/coverage.ps1 -NoBuild` (the same gate as a local run).
